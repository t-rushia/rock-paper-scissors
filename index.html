            Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game played between two
            people in this case you will be playing against the computer. The
            game has three possible outcomes: rock beats scissors, scissors
            beats paper, and paper beats rock. Each time someone wins their
            score will be increased by 1 until either the user or computer
